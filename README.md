# Machine-Learning-Projects

## COVID-19 Analysis Project

This project explores COVID-19 data using machine learning techniques to uncover insights and build predictive models.

### Key Components
- **Dataset (`covid.csv`)**
  - Contains COVID-19 case data used for analysis and modeling.
- **Notebook (`Covid.ipynb`)**
  - End-to-end workflow including:
    - Data cleaning and preprocessing
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
    - Feature engineering for model readiness
    - Predictive modeling and evaluation

### Objectives
- Understand trends and patterns in COVID-19 data
- Apply machine learning algorithms to predict case outcomes
- Demonstrate practical data science workflow from raw data to model deployment

### Skills Showcased
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Visualization of time-series and categorical data
- Model training, testing, and performance evaluation
- Clear documentation and reproducible workflow
